# nz-developable-land
Calculating the amount of developable land at different slope and distance thresholds from Functional Urban Areas (FUA) in New Zealand For Dr Ryan Greenaway-McGrevy (Economics Â» Faculty of Business and Economics) 

## Installation
packages and dependencies handled by conda

`conda create --name calc-developable-land`

`conda activate calc-developable-land`

`conda install --file requirements.txt`

`python -m ipykernel install --user -name=calc-developable-land`

`jupyter notebook`

## Processing 
- Step0 - removing undevelopable land (waterbodies) and generating slope images for each FUA
- Step01_mp - calculating developable area (sqkm) under given slope and distance thresholds
